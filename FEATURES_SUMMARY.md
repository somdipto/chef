# Chef Enhancement Features - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the three major features that have been implemented for the Chef application as requested.

## âœ… Feature 1: Comprehensive API Key Management UI

### What was implemented:
- **Complete API Provider Support**: Added support for all Chef-compatible API providers:
  - Anthropic (Claude) - for claude-3-5-haiku, claude-4-sonnet
  - OpenAI (GPT) - for gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-5
  - Google (Gemini) - for gemini-2.5-pro
  - xAI (Grok) - for grok-3-mini

### Key Features:
- **Unified Settings Interface**: All API keys are managed from a single, intuitive settings page
- **Real-time Validation**: API keys are validated against their respective providers as users type
- **Secure Storage**: API keys are encrypted and stored securely in the Convex database
- **Usage Preferences**: Users can choose when to use their API keys (always vs. quota exhausted)
- **Individual Key Management**: Add, update, or remove API keys for each provider independently

### Files Modified/Created:
- Enhanced `/workspace/convex/apiKeys.ts` - Backend API key management
- Enhanced `/workspace/app/components/settings/ApiKeyCard.tsx` - UI component
- Enhanced `/workspace/convex/schema.ts` - Database schema

## âœ… Feature 2: GitHub Account Connection & Repository Integration

### What was implemented:

- `/workspace/app/components/SettingsContent.client.tsx` - Added GitHub card to settings

## âœ… Feature 3: Repository Import & Project Creation

### What was implemented:
- **Repository Selection Interface**: Multi-select interface for choosing repositories to import
- **Automated Project Creation**: Convert selected repositories into new Chef projects
- **Intelligent Project Setup**: Each imported repository becomes a fully configured Chef project

### Key Features:

  - Checkbox-based selection interface
  - Repository preview with key information
  - Bulk selection capabilities
- **Smart Import Process**:
  - Each repository creates a new Chef project/chat
  - Automatic setup prompts for continuing work on existing codebases
  - Preserves repository metadata and context
- **Seamless Workflow**: Imported projects appear in the main Chef interface ready for development

### Integration Points:
- Connected to existing Chef chat/project system
- Utilizes Chef's AI capabilities for project setup
- Maintains repository connection for future updates

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Backend (Convex)
- **Database Schema**: Extended to support GitHub integration and repository data
- **API Functions**: Secure server-side functions for GitHub API interaction
- **Authentication**: Integrated with existing Chef authentication system
- **Data Security**: All sensitive data (API keys, GitHub tokens) properly encrypted

### Frontend (React/Remix)
- **Component Architecture**: Modular components that integrate seamlessly with existing UI
- **State Management**: Proper React state management for complex interactions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface following Chef's design system

### Security Features
- **OAuth 2.0**: Industry-standard GitHub authentication
- **Token Security**: Server-side token storage and management
- **API Key Encryption**: Secure storage of user API keys
- **Permission Management**: Granular control over GitHub permissions

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### For GitHub Integration:
1. Follow the setup guide in `/workspace/GITHUB_SETUP.md`
2. Configure GitHub OAuth app and environment variables
3. Deploy Convex functions and frontend

### Environment Variables Needed:
```bash
# Backend (Convex)
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret

# Frontend (Vite)
VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
```

## ðŸŽ¯ User Experience
